# Latin Squares

This is a small package for generating and manipulating [Latin
Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square). It was created to support
games an other applications for the [Callysto Project](https://callysto.ca).

## Getting Started
This package implements a `LatinSquare` object with various methods to
initialize, generate new squares, check validity and things like that.

```python
from latinsq import LatinSquare

l = LatinSquare(n=3)
l
```
